This tool is a simple calculator for people who want to know the network speed in which they transferred data.

You will need to supply the total data transferred and the amount of time it took. 

Once you enter in the data, it calculates via the following:

Example: I transferred a 16 MB file and it took 15 mins and 12 seconds to complete.

16 MB = 16,000,000,000 Bytes

Bytes to Bits; 1 byte = 8 bits

16,000,000,000 * 8 = 128,000,000,000 bits

15 mins = 900 seconds 

900 + 12 = 912 seconds

128,000,000,000 bits / 912 seconds = 140,350,877.19 bits per second

140,350,877.19 / 1,000,000 = 140.35 Mbps
